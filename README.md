# Random Password Generator

This is a simple Random Password Generator website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate random passwords and copy them to the clipboard for easy use.

## Features

- Generate a random password with a single click.
- The password contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Users can copy the generated password to the clipboard by clicking a button.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The styling for the password generator UI.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript code responsible for generating and copying the password.
- `images`: Folder containing images for the buttons (e.g., generate and copy icons).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Click the **Generate Password** button to create a random password.
4. Click the copy icon next to the password field to copy the generated password.

## How It Works

- **Password Generation**: A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols is used to generate a random password.
- **Copying Password**: Clicking the copy icon selects the password and copies it to the clipboard.
